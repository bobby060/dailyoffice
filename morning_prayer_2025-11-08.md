## Psalms

### The Psalm Appointed
*Sixty Day Cycle*
### Psalm 22
*Deus, Deus meus*
  My God, my God, why have you forsaken me, *
  and are so far from my cry, and from the words of my complaint?
  **O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not hear; ***
  **in the night season also, but I find no rest.**
  But you remain holy, *
  enthroned upon the praises of Israel.
  **Our fathers hoped in you; ***
  **they trusted in you, and you delivered them.**
  They called upon you, and were delivered; *
  they put their trust in you, and were not confounded.
  **But as for me, I am a worm, and no man, ***
  **scorned by all, and the outcast of the people.**
  All those who see me laugh me to scorn; *
  they curl their lips, and shake their heads, saying,
  **“He trusted in God, that he would deliver him; ***
  **let him deliver him, if he will have him.”**
  But you are he that took me out of my mother’s womb; *
  you were my hope, when I was yet upon my mother’s breasts.
  **I have been cast upon you ever since I was born; ***
  **you are my God, even from my mother’s womb.**
  O go not far from me, for trouble is near at hand, *
  and there is none to help me.
  **Many oxen have come around me; ***
  **fat bulls of Bashan close me in on every side.**
  They gape at me with their mouths, *
  like a ravening and a roaring lion.
  **I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; ***
  **my heart also in the midst of my body is like melting wax.**
  My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cleaves to my gums, *
  and you bring me into the dust of death.
  **For many dogs have come about me, ***
  **and the council of the wicked lays siege against me.**
  They pierced my hands and my feet; I can count all my bones; *
  they stand staring and looking upon me.
  **They part my garments among them, ***
  **and casts lots for my clothing.**
  But be not far from me, O Lᴏʀᴅ. *
  You are my succor; hasten to help me.
  **Deliver my soul from the sword, ***
  **my life from the power of the dog.**
  Save me from the lion’s mouth, *
  and my soul in misery from among the horns of wild oxen.
  **I will declare your Name to my brethren; ***
  **in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.**
  O praise the Lᴏʀᴅ, you that fear him; *
  magnify him, all you seed of Jacob, and fear him, all you seed of Israel.
  **For he has not despised nor abhorred the low estate of the poor; ***
  **he has not hidden his face from him, but when he called unto him, he heard him.**
  My praise is of you in the great congregation; *
  my vows will I perform in the sight of those who fear him.
  **The poor shall eat and be satisfied; ***
  **those who seek after the Lᴏʀᴅ shall praise him; may your hearts live for ever.**
  All the ends of the world shall remember, and be turned unto the Lᴏʀᴅ, *
  and all the families of the nations shall worship before him.
  **For the kingdom is the Lᴏʀᴅ’s, ***
  **and he is the Governor among the peoples.**
  All those who sleep in the earth, how shall they worship him? *
  All those who go down into the dust, how shall they kneel before him?
  **But my life shall be preserved in his sight, and my children shall worship him; ***
  **they shall tell of the Lord to the generations to come;**
  And to a people yet unborn shall they declare his righteousness, *
  that he has brought it to pass.

  **Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; ***
**as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.**

## First Reading

### The First Lesson
*II Kings 21*
A reading from the Second Book of Kings, beginning with the twenty-first chapter, the first verse

> <sup>21</sup> Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hephzibah. <sup>2</sup> And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord , according to the despicable practices of the nations whom the Lord drove out before the people of Israel. <sup>3</sup> For he rebuilt the high places that Hezekiah his father had destroyed, and he erected altars for Baal and made an Asherah, as Ahab king of Israel had done, and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them. <sup>4</sup> And he built altars in the house of the Lord , of which the Lord had said, “In Jerusalem will I put my name. ” <sup>5</sup> And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord . <sup>6</sup> And he burned his son as an offering and used fortune-telling and omens and dealt with mediums and with necromancers. He did much evil in the sight of the Lord , provoking him to anger. <sup>7</sup> And the carved image of Asherah that he had made he set in the house of which the Lord said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever. <sup>8</sup> And I will not cause the feet of Israel to wander anymore out of the land that I gave to their fathers, if only they will be careful to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the Law that my servant Moses commanded them. ” <sup>9</sup> But they did not listen, and Manasseh led them astray to do more evil than the nations had done whom the Lord destroyed before the people of Israel. <sup>10</sup> And the Lord said by his servants the prophets, <sup>11</sup> “Because Manasseh king of Judah has committed these abominations and has done things more evil than all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols, <sup>12</sup> therefore thus says the Lord , the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing upon Jerusalem and Judah such disaster that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle. <sup>13</sup> And I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria, and the plumb line of the house of Ahab, and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down. <sup>14</sup> And I will forsake the remnant of my heritage and give them into the hand of their enemies, and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies, <sup>15</sup> because they have done what is evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day. ” <sup>16</sup> Moreover, Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another, besides the sin that he made Judah to sin so that they did what was evil in the sight of the Lord . <sup>17</sup> Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did, and the sin that he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? <sup>18</sup> And Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his house, in the garden of Uzza, and Amon his son reigned in his place. <sup>19</sup> Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. <sup>20</sup> And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord , as Manasseh his father had done. <sup>21</sup> He walked in all the way in which his father walked and served the idols that his father served and worshiped them. <sup>22</sup> He abandoned the Lord , the God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the Lord . <sup>23</sup> And the servants of Amon conspired against him and put the king to death in his house. <sup>24</sup> But the people of the land struck down all those who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place. <sup>25</sup> Now the rest of the acts of Amon that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? <sup>26</sup> And he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza, and Josiah his son reigned in his place.

The Word of the Lord.
**Thanks be to God.**

## Second Reading

### The Second Lesson
*Acts 12:1-24*
A reading from the Acts of the Apostles, beginning with the twelfth chapter, the first verse

> <sup>12</sup> About that time Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church. <sup>2</sup> He killed James the brother of John with the sword, <sup>3</sup> and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread. <sup>4</sup> And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people. <sup>5</sup> So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church. <sup>6</sup> Now when Herod was about to bring him out, on that very night, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison. <sup>7</sup> And behold, an angel of the Lord stood next to him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, “Get up quickly. ” And the chains fell off his hands. <sup>8</sup> And the angel said to him, “Dress yourself and put on your sandals. ” And he did so. And he said to him, “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me. ” <sup>9</sup> And he went out and followed him. He did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. <sup>10</sup> When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened for them of its own accord, and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel left him. <sup>11</sup> When Peter came to himself, he said, “Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting. ” <sup>12</sup> When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying. <sup>13</sup> And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer. <sup>14</sup> Recognizing Peter's voice, in her joy she did not open the gate but ran in and reported that Peter was standing at the gate. <sup>15</sup> They said to her, “You are out of your mind. ” But she kept insisting that it was so, and they kept saying, “It is his angel! ” <sup>16</sup> But Peter continued knocking, and when they opened, they saw him and were amazed. <sup>17</sup> But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, “Tell these things to James and to the brothers. ” Then he departed and went to another place. <sup>18</sup> Now when day came, there was no little disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter. <sup>19</sup> And after Herod searched for him and did not find him, he examined the sentries and ordered that they should be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent time there. <sup>20</sup> Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and they came to him with one accord, and having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food. <sup>21</sup> On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat upon the throne, and delivered an oration to them. <sup>22</sup> And the people were shouting, “The voice of a god, and not of a man! ” <sup>23</sup> Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down, because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and breathed his last. <sup>24</sup> But the word of God increased and multiplied.

The Word of the Lord.
**Thanks be to God.**

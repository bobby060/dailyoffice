For there is wrath gone out against us, and the plague has begun. That dreadful arrow of yours sticks fast in our flesh, and the venom thereof fires our blood and drinks up our spirits. Should you suffer it to bring us all to the dust of death, we must yet still acknowledge that you are righteous, O Lord, and your judgements are just. For our transgressions multiplied against you, as the sand on the sea-shore might justly bring over us a deluge of your wrath. The cry of our sins that has pierced the very heavens might well return with showers of vengeance upon our heads. While our earth is defiled by the inhabitants of it, what wonder; if you command an evil angel to pour out his vial into our air to fill it with infection and the noisome pestilence and so to turn the very breath of our Life into the savour of death unto us all! But yet we beseech you, O our God, forget not to be gracious: neither shut up your loving kindness in displeasure. For his sake, who himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses, have mercy upon us; and say to the destroying Angel, &ldquo;It is enough&rdquo;. O let that blood of sprinkling, which speaks better things then that of Abel be upon the Lintel and the two side posts in all our dwellings, that the destroyer may pass by. Let the sweet odor of your blessed Son&#39;s all-sufficient sacrifice and intercession (infinitely more prevalent than the typical incense of Aaron) interpose between the living and the dead and be our full and perfect atonement, ever acceptable with you, that the plague may be stayed. O let us live and we will praise your Name, and these your judgments shall teach us to look every man into the plague of his own heart: that being cleansed from all our sins, we may serve you with pure hearts all our days, perfecting holiness in your fear until we come at last where there is no more sickness nor death through your tender mercies in him alone who is our Life, and our health, and our salvation, Jesus Christ, our ever blessed savior and redeemer.&nbsp;<strong>Amen.</strong></p>",

And especially to this Congregation present, give the abundance of thy grace; that with one heart we may desire the health and increase of thy holy Church, and with one mouth may profess the faith once delivered to the saints. Defend us from the sins of heresy and schism. And grant that the course of this world may be so peaceably ordered by thy governance, that thy Church may joyfully serve thee in all godly quietness; that so they may walk in the ways of truth and peace, and at the day of judgment be numbered with thy Saints in glory everlasting; through the merits of the same thy blessed Son Jesus Christ, the gracious Shepherd and Bishop of our souls, who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the same Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without end. <strong>Amen.</strong></p>",

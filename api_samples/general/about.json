    "answer": "<p>The Old Testament is read in its entirety once each year (with the exception of a few passages in Leviticus, Numbers, Joshua, Judges, Ezra, Nehemiah, Ezekiel, and the majority of Chronicles). The Gospels and Acts are read in their entirety twice each year, at Morning Prayer during the first part of the year, at Evening Prayer during the second part of the year. The Epistles are read twice each year in the opposite pattern, except for the Revelation to John, which is read only once, during the Advent season. Select passages of the Apocrypha have been retained. In general, readings move continuously through books of the Bible, interrupted only by Holy Days. For most Holy Days a single proper lesson is included, usually in Morning Prayer. For major feasts of our Lord, two proper lessons are included.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Adapted from the Book of Common Prayer (2019)</h5>",
